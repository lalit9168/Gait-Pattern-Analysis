# Gait-Pattern-Analysis
 I've devised a robust healthcare computer vision system, analyzing gait patterns in real-time to detect five medical conditions: steppage, hydrocephalus, Parkinson's, hemiplegia, and normal gait. This system aids in early diagnosis and tailored treatment plans for patients, revolutionizing gait-related illness management.
